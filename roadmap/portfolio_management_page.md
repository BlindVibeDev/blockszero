## User Experience Considerations

### Information Hierarchy
1. Most critical metrics (total value, daily change) should be immediately visible
2. Detailed holdings and performance available through intuitive navigation
3. Advanced features (tax reporting, optimization) accessible but not overwhelming

### Progressive Disclosure
- Core portfolio data visible initially
- Detailed analysis and advanced features available on demand
- Complex settings and configurations in dedicated sections

### Accessibility Requirements
- All financial data must be accessible via screen readers
- Color is not the sole indicator of performance (up/down)
- Keyboard navigation for all portfolio management functions
- Clear text alternatives for all charts and visualizations

### Error Prevention
- Confirmation for critical actions (deleting holdings, transactions)
- Validation of manual data entry
- Clear feedback for calculation limitations
- Autosave functionality to prevent data loss

## Future Roadmap

### Near-term (1-3 months)
1. Complete core portfolio tracking functionality
2. Implement transaction history interface
3. Add basic performance metrics and visualization
4. Implement data export functionality

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
1. Develop tax reporting capabilities
2. Add benchmark comparison features
3. Implement basic portfolio optimization
4. Add import functionality for exchange data

### Long-term (6+ months)
1. Build advanced portfolio simulation tools
2. Implement AI-driven portfolio recommendations
3. Add multi-portfolio management capabilities
4. Develop collaborative portfolio sharing features

## Implementation Recommendations

### Best Technical Approach
Implement a hybrid storage solution with:
1. IndexedDB for client-side portfolio data with encryption
2. Firebase/Supabase for cloud synchronization and backup
3. Server-side calculation for complex metrics
4. WebWorkers for intensive client-side calculations

### Most Cost-effective Approach
Focus on core functionality with:
1. Improved localStorage implementation with compression
2. Optimized client-side calculations with memoization
3. Basic visualization with efficient rendering
4. Manual import/export instead of automatic synchronization

### Most Scalable Approach
Design for growth with:
1. Microservice architecture for portfolio functions
2. Redis caching for frequent calculations
3. Chunked data loading for large portfolios
4. Event-driven updates to minimize recalculations
