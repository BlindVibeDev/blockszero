- **Color Contrast**: All text must meet WCAG AA standards
- **Text Scaling**: Component should handle increased text sizes gracefully

## Future Roadmap

1. **Near-term Enhancements (1-2 Sprints)**
   - Complete gas fees monitor implementation
   - Add historical context to market metrics
   - Enhance visualization of market dominance

2. **Medium-term Additions (3-6 Sprints)**
   - Implement market correlation matrix
   - Add sector-based market analysis
   - Create customizable metric display options

3. **Long-term Vision**
   - Predictive market indicators using AI
