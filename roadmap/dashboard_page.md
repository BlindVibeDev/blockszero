- **Empty States**: Clear guidance when no components are selected

## Future Roadmap

1. **Near-term Enhancements (1-2 Sprints)**
   - Complete custom layout creation functionality
   - Enhance mobile responsiveness
   - Add component-specific settings

2. **Medium-term Additions (3-6 Sprints)**
   - Implement cloud synchronization
   - Add layout sharing capabilities
   - Create advanced filtering for component selection

3. **Long-term Vision**
