# Portfolio Snapshot Component PRD

## Overview
The Portfolio Snapshot component provides users with a quick overview of their cryptocurrency holdings, performance metrics, and allocation breakdown. It serves as a dashboard widget that gives users immediate visibility into their portfolio status without requiring navigation to the full portfolio page.

## Current Status: 游리 In Progress

- **Current Implementation**: Simple percentage breakdown by asset.
- **Technical Dependencies**: PortfolioContext, token categorization data.
- **Required for Completion**:
  - Multi-dimensional allocation analysis
  - Category-based grouping (Layer 1, DeFi, NFT, etc.)
  - Risk-based allocation visualization
  - Rebalancing indicators
- **Implementation Options**:
  - Best: Interactive treemap visualization with drill-down capabilities
  - Most Cost-Effective: Enhanced pie charts with filtering
  - Most Scalable: Client-side computed views based on raw portfolio data

### 游댮 Risk Analysis (Not Started)

- **Technical Dependencies**: Historical price data, volatility calculations, correlation matrix.
- **Required for Implementation**:
  - Volatility calculation for individual assets and portfolio
  - Concentration risk scoring
  - Correlation analysis between holdings
  - Risk-adjusted return metrics (Sharpe ratio, etc.)
- **Implementation Options**:
  - Best: Comprehensive risk analysis engine with Monte Carlo simulations
  - Most Cost-Effective: Basic volatility and concentration metrics
  - Most Scalable: Server-side risk calculations with client-side visualization

### 游댮 Portfolio Optimization (Not Started)
- **Description**: Recommendations for portfolio improvements based on modern portfolio theory.
- **Technical Dependencies**: Risk-return optimization algorithms, efficient frontier calculations.
- **Required for Implementation**:
  - Efficient frontier calculation
  - Target allocation recommendations
  - Rebalancing suggestions
  - What-if scenario modeling
- **Implementation Options**:
  - Best: Machine learning-based optimization with multiple strategies
  - Most Cost-Effective: Basic modern portfolio theory implementation
  - Most Scalable: API-based optimization service with precomputed recommendations

## Technical Implementation

### Data Management
- **Current Implementation**: Uses PortfolioContext for portfolio data and CryptoContext for current prices.
- **Data Flow**: 
  - Holdings data from PortfolioContext
  - Current prices from CryptoContext
  - Historical prices for performance calculation
- **Enhancement Options**:
  - Implement real-time portfolio updates via WebSockets
  - Add data persistence with localStorage or IndexedDB
  - Create portfolio snapshot history for trend analysis

### Visualization
- **Current Implementation**: Basic charts for allocation and simple metrics display.
- **Libraries**: Chart.js for basic visualizations.
- **Enhancement Options**:
  - Migrate to D3.js for more complex visualizations
  - Add interactive elements for exploration
  - Implement responsive designs for different card sizes

### Performance Optimization
- **Current Implementation**: Basic rendering optimization.
- **Enhancement Options**:
  - Implement calculation memoization for performance metrics
  - Add incremental updates rather than full recalculations
  - Create background calculation workers for complex metrics

## User Experience Considerations

- **Information Hierarchy**: Most important metrics should have visual prominence
- **Personalization**: Allow users to configure which metrics are most important to them
- **Context**: Provide benchmarking and historical context for performance
- **Actionability**: Clear indications when portfolio needs attention (rebalancing, high risk, etc.)
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with high-level metrics with ability to drill down

## Accessibility Requirements

- **Screen Reader Support**: All charts and metrics should have proper ARIA labels
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Component should be fully navigable without mouse
- **Color Independence**: Use patterns and labels in addition to colors
- **Text Alternatives**: Provide text summaries of visual data

## Future Roadmap

1. **Near-term Enhancements (1-2 Sprints)**
   - Complete holdings visualization with interactive charts
   - Enhance performance metrics with multiple timeframes
   - Implement basic allocation analysis by category

2. **Medium-term Additions (3-6 Sprints)**
   - Implement risk analysis features
   - Add benchmark comparison functionality
   - Create portfolio health score based on multiple factors

3. **Long-term Vision**
   - AI-powered portfolio recommendations
   - Advanced scenario modeling
   - Tax-aware performance tracking

## Implementation Recommendations

- **Best Technical Approach**: Create a dedicated portfolio analytics engine that can perform complex calculations server-side, with a rich visualization layer in the frontend using D3.js.
- **Most Cost-Effective Approach**: Enhance the current client-side implementation with better visualization and more sophisticated but focused metrics that provide the most value.
- **Most Scalable Approach**: Implement a microservice architecture where portfolio data, market data, and analytics are separate services that can scale independently.
- **Recommended Next Steps**: Focus on completing the basic holdings visualization and core performance metrics, then enhance the allocation breakdown with categorization before moving to more advanced features.
