# Exchange API Integration PRD

## Overview
The Exchange API Integration will enable the platform to connect with cryptocurrency exchanges, providing real-time data, order book information, trading capabilities, and account/portfolio synchronization. This integration will transform the platform from an information tool to a comprehensive trading platform, allowing users to execute trades directly from within the application.

## Technical Implementation

### API Integration Architecture
- **Recommended Approach**: Modular architecture with exchange-specific adapters implementing standard interfaces.
- **Key Components**:
  - Exchange adapter interface
  - Exchange-specific implementations
  - Data normalization layer
  - WebSocket connection pool
  - Request rate limiting and queueing
  - Retry and fallback mechanisms

### Authentication & Security
- **Recommended Approach**: Dedicated secure credential management system with proper encryption.
- **Key Components**:
  - API key encryption at rest
  - Secure key transmission
  - Least-privilege API key permissions
  - Regular key rotation mechanisms
  - IP whitelisting where supported
  - Activity logging and alerting

### Data Processing Pipeline
- **Recommended Approach**: Event-driven architecture with real-time processing capabilities.
- **Key Components**:
  - WebSocket event handlers
  - Real-time data processing
  - Time-series data storage
  - Data aggregation services
  - Normalization and transformation
  - Caching layer

### Performance Considerations
- **WebSocket Management**: Efficient connection pooling and heartbeat monitoring
- **Data Structures**: Optimized for high-frequency updates (especially order books)
- **Memory Usage**: Careful management of real-time data streams
- **Processing Overhead**: Balancing real-time needs with system resources
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect exchange API limitations while maximizing data freshness

## User Experience Considerations

- **Exchange Selection**: Clear interface for selecting and managing exchange connections
- **API Key Management**: Secure and user-friendly API key input and management
- **Data Consistency**: Consistent presentation of data across different exchanges
- **Latency Indication**: Clear indicators of data freshness and potential delays
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for API issues
- **Trading Workflows**: Intuitive order placement with confirmation steps
- **Risk Controls**: Visualizing risk levels and implementing confirmation for large trades

## Security Requirements

- **API Key Storage**: Encryption of all API keys at rest
- **Transmission Security**: Secure transmission of credentials and trading commands
- **Permission Scoping**: Requesting minimum necessary API permissions
- **Key Management**: Tools for key rotation and permission auditing
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all trading activities
- **Fraud Protection**: Mechanisms to detect unauthorized trading attempts

## Integration Priorities

1. **Phase 1: Read-Only Integration**
   - Price data integration
   - Order book visualization
   - Trading history
   - Account balance viewing (read-only)

2. **Phase 2: Basic Trading**
   - Market order placement
   - Limit order placement
   - Order cancellation
   - Basic portfolio tracking

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Trading**
   - Advanced order types
   - Order modification
   - Trading rules and automation
   - Cross-exchange arbitrage tools

## Exchange Support Roadmap

1. **Tier 1 Exchanges (Initial Support)**
   - Binance
   - Coinbase Pro
   - Kraken
   - FTX

2. **Tier 2 Exchanges (Secondary Phase)**
   - KuCoin
   - Bitfinex

## Implementation Recommendations

- **Best Technical Approach**: Build a custom exchange integration system with standardized adapters for each exchange, a secure API key management service, and a real-time data processing pipeline using WebSockets, with a focus on security and reliability.
- **Most Cost-Effective Approach**: Leverage the CCXT library for unified exchange API access, implementing client-side security features and focusing first on the most critical exchanges and features.
- **Most Scalable Approach**: Implement a microservice architecture with dedicated services for authentication, market data, order management, and portfolio tracking, connected via message queues for high throughput.
- **Recommended Next Steps**: Start with a proof-of-concept for read-only data from a single major exchange (e.g., Binance), focusing on establishing the proper architecture, security practices, and data normalization before expanding to additional exchanges or trading features.

## Technical Risk Assessment

- **API Changes**: Exchange APIs frequently change, requiring ongoing maintenance
- **Rate Limiting**: Exchange rate limits may restrict feature capabilities
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: API key management presents significant security risks
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Different regions have varying requirements for trading platforms
- **Exchange Outages**: Dependency on external services affects platform reliability
- **Data Consistency**: Different exchanges report data differently, creating normalization challenges

## Mitigation Strategies

- **Modular Design**: Exchange-specific code isolated in adapter modules
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function if specific exchanges are unavailable
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Thorough testing of all trading workflows
- **Monitoring System**: Real-time monitoring of API status and data quality
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation of exchange-specific behaviors
- **Versioning**: Version control of exchange adapters to manage API changes
